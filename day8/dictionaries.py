# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

# Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
# Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

# It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)
# -------------------------------

# Accessing Items
# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
# There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
x = thisdict.get("model")

# The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.keys() 

# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change
    # dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year'])
    # dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year', 'color'])

# The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.values()

# The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
x = thisdict.items()
# dict_items([('brand', 'Ford'), ('model', 'Mustang'), ('year', 1964)])


# To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")


# Change Values
# You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

# Update the "year" of the car by using the update() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})

# Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

# The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

# You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
# You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:


# Copy a Dictionary
# You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
# Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)


# Access Items in Nested Dictionaries
# To access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary:
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])
