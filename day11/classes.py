# Python Classes/Objects
# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

# The __init__() Function
# The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)

# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

# Object Methods
# Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
